Project: Procedural Level Design using Genetic Algorithms
Coursework, University of Alberta

Developed a genetic algorithm to optimize procedural content generation for game levels, adapting to various AI evaluator preferences.
Implemented in C# within Unity, utilizing LevelOptimizer.cs to generate levels that fit specific player preferences such as obstacle density and pellet placement.
Achieved fitness goals by evolving levels through mutation and crossover methods, ensuring optimized levels scored >0.9 in fitness evaluations.
Demonstrated understanding of genetic algorithms and their application in game development, contributing to enhanced player experiences through adaptive level design.
Successfully integrated procedural generation techniques to create engaging and dynamic game environments.
